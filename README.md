VideoImageDelta is a program that scans videos for set features. Designed primarily for video game speedrunning, it can be used to detect loading, extract individual level records, assist with changed timing methods, verify video integrity and, in some cases, help with catching cheaters. This start the foundation for the eventual video-based autosplitter for [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit).

This readme will be updated over time with relevant information.
